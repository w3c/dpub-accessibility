    <section class="introductory">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>This document provides informative guidance (but does not set requirements) with regard to interpreting and applying Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 [WCAG20] to the needs of digital publishing.</p>
      <p>While the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is primarily concerned with web technologies, its guidance is also relevant to non-web technologies, such as digital publishing published using web-based technological tools.</p>
      <p>The current document is focused on the accessibility of digital publishing to people with disabilities and is not intended to supplant any other W3C work. </p>

<section class="introductory">
      <h3>WCAG 2.0 and Digital Publishing</h3>
      <p><em>"Digital Publishing"</em> is a generic term for the broad ecosystem of electronic journals, magazines, news, or book publishing (authors, creators, publishers, news organizations, booksellers, accessibility and internationalization specialists, etc.). The formats used by eBook readers and tablets for electronic books, magazines, journals and educational resources are largely based on W3C Technologies, such as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, MathML, or various Web API-s. Commercial publishers also rely on W3C technologies in their back-end processing all the way from authoring through to delivering the printed or electronic product and beyond. In general one can say that the Publishing Industry is one of the largest communities relying large palette of W3C technologies. </p>
      <p> However, the alignment of the needs of the Publishing Industry and the various W3C recommendations is not satisfactory. Necessary features may be missing in the W3C documents, or may be in draft only; as a result, for example, EPUB3, the standard for electronic books, had to introduce its own extensions to cover the needs of publishing.</p>
</section>
<section class="introductory">
      <h2>Other W3C-WAI Guidelines Related to Digital Publishing</h2>
<section class="introductory">
      <h3>UAAG 2.0</h3>
      <p>The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">UAAG2</a>]   is meant for the developers of user agents (e.g. web browsers and e-readers). A user agent that follows UAAG 2.0 will improve accessibility through its own user interface, through options it provides for rendering and interacting with ​content, and through its ability to communicate with other technologies, including assistive technologies.</p>
      <p>To assist developers of e-readers, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/">UAAG 2.0 Reference</a> support document needs to contain examples relevant to digital publishing. It has not been within the scope of this task force to create a note with some examples for the UAAG team. However, it should be a product of future digital publishing accessibility work.</p>
</section>
<section class="introductory">
      <h3>ATAG 2.0</h3>
      <p>The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">ATAG2</a>] provides guidelines for the developers of authoring tools. An authoring tool that follows ATAG 2.0 will be both more accessible to authors with disabilities (Part A) and designed to enable, support, and promote the production of more accessible web content by all authors (Part B). </p>
      <p>To assist developers of authoring tools for digital publishing, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20/">Implementing ATAG 2.0</a> support document needs to contain examples relevant to digital publishing. It has not been within the scope of this task force to create a note with some examples for the ATAG team. However, it should be a product of future digital publishing accessibility work.</p>

    <h2>Discussion of Digital Publishing Issues not currently addressed by W3C standards</h2>
        <section>

        <h3>Page Numbers</h3>
			<p>Suggestion: UAG suggestion and WCAG suggestion, probably also  ATAG
suggestion </p>
       
       		<p>Comments: For electronic publications -- especially those
intended to have direct correspondence to printed "hardcopy" publications
such as textbooks -- a way needs to exist for a user to accurately identify
the page number, and to navigate accordingly. This method must be
accessible, and should not disrupt continuous reading by screen reader
users, and should be accurate and accessible for users using Assistive
Technologies which may resize or reflow text on the screen. </p>

			<p>A method for providing page numbers is addressed in <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/">CSS Paged Media Module Level 3</a>
but it applies to the scenario of pagination of text being sent to a printer
from a web page. However, there may be something that could be adopted or
extended from this model, where rather than having pagination be determined
by the dimensions of the paper to be printed a upon, a publisher supplies
the page dimensions and rules for page numbering in metadata, and the user
agent allows the end-user to access the information. </p>

			<p>More investigation is necessary.</p>

			<p>References</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#margin-boxes">CSS Paged Media Module Level
						3</a> Page-Margin Boxes</li>
				</ul>        

        <h3>Drop Cap</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion, WAI outreach suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#first-letter">The CSS 3 selector first-letter</a> allows the creation of accessible drop caps. However, it is not widely supported. When drop caps are created without using this CSS3 selector, this causes accessibility issues when the two components of the word are read as separate words. Outreach to user agent creators and content creators is needed.</p>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#first-letter">The CSS 3 selector first-letter</a></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Notes (Footnotes, Asides, Author Notes, etc.)</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: No action item</p>
        <p>Comments: DPUB-ARIA 1.0 includes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-dpub-aria-1.0-20150707/#dpub-footnote">dpub-footnote</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-dpub-aria-1.0-20150707/#dpub-footnotes">dpub-footnotes</a>. These roles convey that information is ancillary without conveying information about positioning. This allows authors and user agents to achieve positioning using CSS or scripting while maintaining the flow and navigability of the content.</p>
        <p>References:</p>

        <h3>Positional location of text to indicate different speakers</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: Unclear. Possibly all use cases can be addressed with CSS.</p>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Use Case: comic strips have different speakers on different sides of the page. </li>
             <li>Use Case: poetry </li>
             <li>Use Case: different voices for different speakers. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/">CSS Speech Module</a></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Phonetic spellings of proper nouns and jargon terms</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG and WCAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: Publishers need to be able to put in suggested pronunciation for proper nouns, acronyms, and field-specific jargon terms. The Pronunciation Lexicon (PLS) exists but it is exceptionally  difficult to use, and doesn't scale well to a large publisher's use cases.</p>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use Case (WCAG): A chemistry book needs to use the accepted pronunciations of chemistry terms to maximize clarity. It references a pre-existing pronunciation dictionary made available by the American Chemical Society that uses community-agreed-upon standards.
            <li>Use Case (WCAG): The trade novel THE LIVES OF CHRISTOPHER CHANT by Diana Wynne Jones, in which there is a plot point that a character's name is spelled "Ralph" but pronounced "Rafe," can be correctly encoded using a local pronunciation dictionary.
            <li>UseCase (UAAG): Reading systems support the pronunciation dictionary reference and expose the data to Accessibility APIs.
        </ol>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/05/15-dpub-minutes.html#item01">Initial conversation in DPUB A11Y TF Meeting</a></li>

             <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/">Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS)</a></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>layout's influence on comprehension</h3>
			<p>Comments: There is currently no way to provide visual information about
the layout of text on a page that is not semantically determined. Certain
literary styles such as poetry may use the placement of text to convey extra
meaning. For instance, a poem about a tree may be arranged to look like a
tree. There is no good way for someone  accessing the text through Assistive
Technology which speaks the text or changes its appearance to be made aware
of this additional information. We have no suggested approaches at this
time. </p>

        </ul>


        <h3>Deeply Nested Heading Levels Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: Techniques / Tutorials suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: It is not easy to determine what best practice is for deeply nested  headings, headings that go beyond &lt;h6&gt;. Best Practices should be clearly established and easy to find.  Use cases in books are more frequent than other circumstances. This is likeliest to occur if an &lt;aside&gt; begins with &lt;h5&gt; or &lt;h6&gt;. It may  also occur in encyclopedias and similarly larger and detailed works.</p>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>


        <h3>Semantically needed List-Head</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: WCAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: There is no clear method of associating a title of a list with the list items. This can be accomplished using artificial wrappers, such as &lt;div&gt;, but it seems that the list elements (&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;) should include titles. It is tempting to use the h1 – h6 elements, but these have the native semantics of aria role=”heading”, offering unwanted default navigation. It would be useful if there were a role of element called "listtitle" or something similar.</p>
        <p>The following is a simple example:
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;listtitle&gt;Noble Gases&lt;/listtitle&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Krypton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xenon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
</p>

        </ul>


        <h3>Skippability</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: This is a user preference / personalization issue. User must be able to customize what is visible, what is read, etc.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>This should be an option for visual as well as aural presentation.</li>
            <li>Skipped elements need to be discoverable later.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Use Case: User does not want to hear page numbers or headers, but does want to hear footnotes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>References:</p>

        </ul>


        <h3>Assessments</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: Mark Hakkinen is driving gap analysis and merging IMS QTI/APIP accessibility model to HTML/ARIA and WCAG. The bulk of these recommendations will come from their group; we will coordinate with them as they request. We've done initial outreach.  </p>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Use Case: Use Case: admins need to be able to control who gets extra time on timed controls, and how much.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/accesslearn/">Accessible Online Learning Community Group</a></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Escapability</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: Need to be able to immediately move to the next non-contained block element.</p>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Use Case: Skip from the middle of a long, complex table to the next paragraph or header.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Diagrammar</h3>
        <p>Diagrammar is a framework to hold multiple description types, in order to make images, tables, graphics accessible.
			The Diagrammar, defines a data model for image description metadata. It provides a structured, standard way for image description data to be modeled, including multiple different types of descriptions for each image, various descriptions and pointers to tactile graphic files, etc.
		</p>
		<p>For a given image there may be one or more of the following accessibility tags which links to the supplementary information.</p>
		<ul>
             <li><a href="http://www.daisy.org/z3998/2012/auth/profiles/descriptions/1.0/schemadoc/subfiles/e-about01.html">about</a></li>

    	</ul>
    	<p>Metadata is used to help provide context on what this alternative descriptions and files are.
			Example of the Metadata available would be</p>
		<ul>
             <li>Purpose</li>
             <li>Age / Grade Level</li>
             <li>Quality rating</li>
             <li>Content (ie. Links to the descriptions / files etc.)</li>
   		</ul>
		This metadata could be ultimately searched on to find these alternate image descriptions.
